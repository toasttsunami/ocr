Parse Trees

It is the pictorial representation of how start symbol of a grammar
derives a string from the language.

Properties
	i) Root of a parse tree is always labelled with the start symbol
	ii) Each leaf is always labelled with a token or terminal
	iii) Each intermediate node is always labelled with a nonterminal
	
    NOTE: i) The leaves of a parse tree when read from left to right is
             called yield of the tree.
             
          ii) Language defined by a grammar is the set of all strings that are
              generated by some parse tree formed by that grammar
          
Types of Parsers

1. Universal

	. It can parse any kind of grammar and are not very efficient
	. Algos used -> CYK
		     -> Early's algo
2. Top Down
	- It builds the parse tree from root towards the leaves
